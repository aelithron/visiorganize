# Concepts
Some useful concepts before you begin installing and using Visiorganize are described here.
## Projects
The highest level of organization. A Project, usually linked to a specific GitHub repository, is the base of your storage. A user can have infinite Projects, and can share them.
## Folders
Each Project is made up of mainly Folders. These are groupings of Resources, and they are generally intended to seperate different parts/tasks in a Project.
## Resources
Any type of resource used in a program. The most common Resources are Code Snippets, Links, and Design Schematics, but there are other more specific types such as Color Palettes and GitHub Links. You will also be able to define custom Resources with JSON.
